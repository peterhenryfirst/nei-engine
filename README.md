# NEI (Nila Euphorbia Ibis) ENGINE

It is a basic game engine to use and experiment with different mechanics with canvas and webgl.

The name goes from the wikipedia home with random article:

  - NILA: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nila_%28Ramayana%29
  - AUPHORBIA: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia
  - IBIS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibis

I selected that name because i did not find an approximate name to a game engine.

## OVERVIEW

NEI is a structured game engine, with a basic and easy format to create a 'game'.

To create a new game you have entities that are a desired logic element, that is represented by his components. And each entity can send messages to interact with other entities/components.
